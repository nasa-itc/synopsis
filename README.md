SYNOPSIS: Science Yield improvemeNt via Onboard Prioritization and Summary of Information System
================================================================================================

SYNOPSIS is a system to prioritize the downlink of data products, including
both raw data products as well as "autonomous science data products" that are
extracted onboard the spacecraft to summarize data.

## Setup

1. Run `cmake -S . -B build` to set up the build directory
2. Run `cmake --build build` to build the code
3. Run `cd build && ctest` to execute the tests

## Testing

To test from scratch, run the following commands:

1. `ssh itlinux-b` (or equivalent machine)
2. `git clone git@github.jpl.nasa.gov:SYNOPSIS/synopsis.git`
3. `cd synopsis`
4. Proceed with the Setup steps above

## Architecture Overview

SYNOPSIS is designed to be a modular framework for downlink prioritization to
be incorporated into flight software frameworks such as
[F'](https://nasa.github.io/fprime/) or [cFS](https://cfs.gsfc.nasa.gov/).
Users of the SYNOPSIS library instantiate an `Application` (see `synopsis.hpp`)
along with a number of modules. Modules include:

 - Autonomous Science Data Systems (see `ASDS.hpp`)
 - An Autonomous Science Data Product Database (see `ASDPDB.hpp`)
 - A Downlink Planner (see `DownlinkPlanner.hpp`)
 - A Logger (see `Logger.hpp`)
 - A Clock (see `Clock.hpp`)

The ASDSs are registered with an application instance after construction (see
`Application::add_asds`), whereas the other modules are used during application
construction. After registering ASDSs, the application instance should be
initialized using `Application::init`. A helper function
`Application::memory_requirement` specifies how much pre-allocated memory
should be passed to the application for initialization.

After initialization, new data products can be ingested into SYNOPSIS using the
`Application::accept_dp` function. Data product messages passed to this
function contain information about the data product's origin (i.e., which
instrument produced it), type, location on a filesystem, and metadata location.
Invoking this function will either synchronously or asynchronously (depending
on the design of the ASDS) process the data product to produce an autonomous
science data product (ASDP), which will then be inserted into the ASDP
database (ASDPDB).

SYNOPSIS provides an interface to manually update information in the ASDP DB,
which can be invoked via ground commands. These functions are:

 - `Application::update_science_utility`
 - `Application::update_priority_bin`
 - `Application::update_downlink_state`
 - `Application::update_asdp_metadata`

At any time, the user of SYNOPSIS can also invoke the `Application::prioritize`
function, which will return a prioritized list of ASDPs using a set of
prioritization rules and constraints, along with similarity configuration for
diversity-aware prioritization. This functionality should be invoked prior to
a downlink pass, and the information associated with unique ASDP identifier can
be queried from the ASDP DB to enable transmission to the ground. After
transmission, the downlink state of each transmitted ASDP should be updated so
that subsequent invocations of the `Application::prioritize` function exclude
these data products.

Finally, when SYNOPSIS functionality is no longer required, the
`Application::deinit` function can be used to relinquish the use of the memory
provided during application initialization. Initialization and
de-initialization can be performed as often as necessary (i.e., immediately
prior to and after the invocation of one of the functions above that requires
SYNOPSIS to be initialized). One exception is for asynchronous ASDSs; SYNOPSIS
must be initialized when an ASDS returns its result to be submitted to the ASDP
DB.
